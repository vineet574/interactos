 InteractOS 

 Rethinking How Humans Explore Websites

The way users interact with websites today is outdated and restrictive.
Menus, navigation bars, and static layouts force users to adapt to interfaces.

InteractOS flips this model.

Users express intent, and the website adapts instantly.



 Core Idea

Instead of clicking pages, users tell the website what they want to do:

- “Give me a quick overview”
- “Help me decide”
- “Explain this deeply”

InteractOS interprets intent and dynamically reshapes the experience.



 Key Features

- Intent-based interaction (no navigation menus)
- Adaptive content layouts
- Smooth animated transitions
- Voice-based intent input
- Accessibility-first interaction (keyboard & screen reader friendly)



 Interaction Flow

1. Open the website
2. Type your intent
3. Watch the site adapt
4. Change intent anytime

Same content. Different experience.



 Prototype

This repository contains a working prototype demonstrating:
- Intent detection
- Real-time layout transformation
- Human-centered web exploration



 Future Vision

- Voice and multimodal interaction
- AI-powered intent understanding
- Universal interaction layer for all websites
- Accessibility-first design
