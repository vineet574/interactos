 InteractOS 🚀

 Rethinking How Humans Explore Websites

The way users interact with websites today is outdated and restrictive.
Menus, navigation bars, and static layouts force users to adapt to interfaces.

InteractOS flips this model.

Users express intent, and the website adapts instantly.



 Core Idea

Instead of clicking pages, users tell the website what they want to do:

- “Give me a quick overview”
- “Help me decide”
- “Explain this deeply”

InteractOS interprets intent and dynamically reshapes the experience.



 Key Features

- Intent-based interaction (no navigation menus)
- Adaptive content layouts
- Smooth animated transitions
- Minimal, futuristic UI



 Interaction Flow

1. Open the website
2. Type your intent
3. Watch the site adapt
4. Change intent anytime

Same content. Different experience.



 Prototype
