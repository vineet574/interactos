\# InteractOS — Rethinking Web Interaction



Websites today force users to navigate menus, search bars, and rigid layouts.

InteractOS introduces an intent-driven interaction model where users express goals

instead of clicking pages.



The system interprets user intent and dynamically reshapes the website experience

in real time. The same content can appear as a quick summary, a decision view, or

a deep explanation — without reloading or navigating.



InteractOS is not a website redesign.

It is a new interaction layer for the web.
