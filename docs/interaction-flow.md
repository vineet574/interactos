\# Interaction Flow



1\. User opens the website

2\. No menus or navigation are presented

3\. User types their intent in natural language

4\. System detects interaction mode

5\. Layout and content adapt instantly

6\. User can change intent at any time



This creates a frictionless, human-centered exploration experience.
